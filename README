== Description ==

AutoKey (formerly known as PhotoBump) is a software to create 3D models for
key blanks, bumpkeys and regular keys.

=== Requirements ===

- OpenSCAD (a version > 2014.03 taken from GIT or daily snapshots is recommended)
- pstoedit
- Inkscape
- Python >= 2.7

=== Example ===

In order to create the 3D model for the bump key that was used in my video,
you can run the following command:

python AutoKey.py --bumpkey --profile profiles/ABUS-AB95.svg --definition definitions/ABUS-E20.scad

Once OpenSCAD has started, you can Preview/Render/Export the STL as desired.

=== Profiles ===

In the profiles/ subdirectory, you can find SVG traces created from photos for
certain locks. You can add your own SVG data there if you wish to create a
model for a profile not supported yet by the software. In addition to the SVG,
there is always a profile definition file (.def) that contains dimensional
information about the profile (see profiles/README for more information).

=== System Definitions ===

The definitions/ subdirectory contains system definitions for certain locks.
Such a definition typically contains information such as the key length, the
pin/shoulder distances, key cut heights and angles. For bump keys, it is
possible to deviate from the regular system definitions for better results.

Also see definitions/README for a more detailed documentation.
